# TheCaptain Rails
TODO: Add more description

The gist is that this is housing Rail's specific logic for handling Captain responses and submissions in a Rails project.

Main core feature is the ability to subscribe / explicitly listen for Webhooks that a developer would like to handel in a specific manner.

IE: If a Webhook comes back for an IP or Content analysis. A developer may want to allow specific class handlers to manage / analise these pieces of information differently and directed to other parts of the application.

## Usage
